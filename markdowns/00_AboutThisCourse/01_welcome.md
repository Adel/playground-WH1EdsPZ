# From Java to Haskell

Welcome to this haskell playground!

## Disclaimer
For starters, I don't know anything about Haskell. I am familiar with other languages (Java, Javascript mainly),
and I don't know more than the average programmer on functional programming paradigm. <br/>
However, I was always interested in functional programming, and as happy as I am using some higher order functions which made it through and are used in mainstream languages (map, filter...)
I always wanted to learn more about functional programming concepts. <br/>

#### Why learn haskell instead of any other functional language?

Some of the reasons might be:

* Whenever we read about functional programming languages, haskell is always mentioned.
* To learn best functional programming, it might be easier for someone used
to imperative programming to use a language which does not have imperative ways of solving problems.
   

#### Is haskell difficult to learn?

I don't know, but We will find out. I started reading, a few days ago, [Learn you haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com), and it seems startling at first.<br/>
When I discovered this platform, I thought I could share directly with others what I might learn, and it might be a motive to continue the haskell journey.

#### Is this playground a good way to learn haskell?   

There is not warranty as to the results.<br/>
It might be best to read the above-mentioned book and there are many good books or articles on this subject.

Any help is appreciated. 

## Thanks
* Thanks to JBM who created the playground template (without wich I would have started this)
