# About this playground

Welcome to this haskell playground!<br/>
This playground will be used to share my journey in learning haskell and functional programming.

## Disclaimer
This haskell journey of mine has just started. Coming from an imperative programming background, and new to haskell,
there is no warranty as to the results of this course.

## Aim
* Getting to know haskell
* Learn some functional programming concepts.
* Coding, coding and more coding in haskell.

# Prerequisites
This is a beginner's to haskell course, but a prior knowledge of programming or programming languages is required.

### Why learn a functional programming language?
Some of the reasons might be:
* To learn a new paradigm and become a better developer.
* Higher order functions like map, filter (even flatmap) became part of the imperative programming tools, what else can we benefit from?
* For fun

### Is haskell difficult to learn?
Coming from an imperative background, Haskell seems startling at first.
This playground aim is to make things easier, but learning step by step.<br/>
