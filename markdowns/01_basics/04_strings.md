# Strings

A string is, like in other C like languages, surrounded by double quotes.

```haskell
"this is a string"
```

A single character is surrounded by single quotes.

```haskell
'a'
```

A string is a list of characters. Thus the following will yield True.

```haskell
"abcd" == ['a','b','c','d'] -- is True
```

The empty string "" is a synonym of an empty list.


```haskell
"" == [] -- is True
```
